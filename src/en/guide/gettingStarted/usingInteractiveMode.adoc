Since 3.0, Grails has an interactive mode which makes command execution faster since the JVM doesn't have to be restarted for each command. To use interactive mode simple type 'grails' from the root of any projects and use TAB completion to get a list of available commands. See the screenshot below for an example:

For more information on the capabilities of interactive mode refer to the section on link:commandLine.html#interactiveMode[Interactive Mode] in the user guide.


The Grails Forge Command-line Interface (CLI) offers an interactive mode, which you can access by entering "grails" in your Terminal application or Linux Command Line.

Once you're in the command-line interface, you can enhance your efficiency by utilizing the TAB key for auto-completion. For instance:

[source,console]
----
grails> create
create-app            create-plugin         create-webapp
create-controller     create-restapi
create-domain-class   create-web-plugin
----

This interactive mode provides a convenient way to explore available Grails commands and options, making your Grails development workflow more efficient and user-friendly.
