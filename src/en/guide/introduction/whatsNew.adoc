This section covers all the new features introduced in Grails 7

=== Overview

Grails framework 7 updates Spring Boot to version 3.4. We recommend checking the following Spring technologies release notes for more information.

The minimum Java version required to run Grails 7 has been updated to Java 17.

=== Ubiquitous Containerized Browser Testing with Geb

The https://github.com/grails/geb[Grails Geb Plugin] has received a significant update, introducing test fixtures that enable ubiquitous containerized browser testing.

This new approach is now the recommended way to write functional tests in Grails. However, the previous method using WebDriver binaries remains supported for backward compatibility.

==== Key Features

By extending your test classes with `ContainerGebSpec`, your tests will automatically leverage a containerized browser provided by https://www.testcontainers.org[Testcontainers]. This setup eliminates the need for managing browser versions and ensures consistent test environments.

==== Requirements

To use `ContainerGebSpec`, ensure that you have a compatible container runtime installed. Supported options include:

- **Docker Desktop**
- **OrbStack** (macOS only)
- **Rancher Desktop**
- **Podman Desktop**
- **Colima** (macOS and Linux)

==== How It Works

Once a compatible container runtime is installed, no additional configuration is needed. Simply extend your test classes with `ContainerGebSpec` (instead of `GebSpec`), and the following will happen:

1. A container will be started automatically when you run your integration tests.
2. The container will be configured to launch a browser capable of accessing your application under test.

With this setup, you gain the benefits of containerized testing, such as isolation, reproducibility, and reduced setup complexity.
