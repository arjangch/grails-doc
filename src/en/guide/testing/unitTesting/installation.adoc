To install the unit testing support library add the following dependency to the
`dependencies` block of your `build.gradle` in a Grails application or plugin:

[source,groovy,subs="attributes"]
testCompile "org.grails:grails-gorm-testing-support:{version}"
testCompile "org.grails:grails-web-testing-support:{version}"

NOTE: The dependencies are only required to implement unit tests for Grails Artifacts. Also, if you are not unit testing domain activity, you may not need the GORM testing support library.
