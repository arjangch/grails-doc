=== Command Line Usage


Grails incorporates the powerful build system http://gradle.org[Gradle].

The basic usage scenario is:

[source,groovy]
----
grails <<environment>>* <<command name>>
----

Grails searches in the following directories for Gant scripts to execute:

* `USER_HOME/.grails/scripts`
* `PROJECT_HOME/src/main/scripts/`
* `PROJECT_HOME/plugins/*/scripts`
* `GRAILS_HOME/scripts`

If multiple matches are found Grails will give you a choice of which one to execute.

You can specify the environment that the command executes in with an optional environment parameter, either with one of the built-in environment names:

[source,groovy]
----
grails dev run-app
grails test run-app
grails prod run-app
----

Or using a -D argument if the name is not one of the three standard names:

[source,groovy]
----
grails -Dgrails.env=uat run-app
----

=== Grails Forge Command Line Usage


Grails incorporates a CLI and also uses the powerful build system https://gradle.org[Gradle].

The basic usage scenario is:

[source,console]
----
grails <<command name>> <<options>>*
----

When running Gradle tasks you can specify the environment that the command executes in with an optional grails.env parameter, either with one of the built-in environment names:

[source,console]
----
./gradlew bootRun -Dgrails.env=dev
./gradlew bootRun -Dgrails.env=test
./gradlew bootRun -Dgrails.env=prod
./gradlew bootRun -Dgrails.env=custom
----
